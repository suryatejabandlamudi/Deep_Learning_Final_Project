# Deep Learning Final Project
UB CSE Deep learning course Final Project



The code presented as jupyter notebooks, so that it will be easy to understand the results and reproduce the same results. 
There are 3 parts in the codebase.
1) Dataset Preparation
2) Feature Creation
3) Model Training: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 2-way classification model<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 3-way classification model <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 6-way classification model <br />


All the results from these notebooks is saved in the output cells. Order to run the cells:

1) Part_1_Dataset_Preparation
2) Part_2_Features_Creation
3) Part_2a_training_model_2_way_classification
4) Part_2b_training_model_3_way_classification
5) Part_2c_training_model_6_way_classification

Data/Artifacts can be donwloaded from :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oEnWsLMo6KS2YAR5FvVOLXGKgALIXajE?usp=sharing

Dataset/all_train.tsv from the drive should be used in "Part_1_Dataset_Preparation.ipynb"

Image.zip from the drive should be unzipped and the path where this is unzipped should be used in "Part_2_Features_Creation.ipynb"
