The code presented as jupyter notebooks, so that it will be easy to understand the results and reproduce the same results. 
There are 3 parts in the codebase.
1) Dataset Preparation
2) Feature Creation
3) Model Training: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 2-way classification model<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 3-way classification model <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 6-way classification model <br />


All the results from these notebooks is saved in the output cells. Order to run the cells:

1) Part_1_Dataset_Preparation
2) Part_2_Features_Creation
3) Part_2a_training_model_2_way_classification
4) Part_2b_training_model_3_way_classification
5) Part_2c_training_model_6_way_classification
